# What it is
- This app is an introduction to RealityKit, which renders AR content in SwiftUI context. 
- The app creates a cube mesh, and RealityKit places it in the camera view once it detects a horizontal plane. There is a button that you can tap on to scale the cube mesh by a factor of two every time you tap it.
- The purpose of this app is to give you a quick glance at how you can make AR content in SwiftUI.

# Installation & Run
- To run the app, simply clone this repo to your local end or download it directly and then open on Xcode.
- Please make sure you are connecting your macbook to a physical iPhone device to test, as AR doesn't work in preview or simulator.
- You might face some configuration issues if this is your first time running an AR app, but you can generally solve it by following Xcode's guide. If you can't figure it out, try google and then ask us.
- When you run the app on your iPhone, move around a little bit because your camera needs to detect a horizontal plane (the floor) before it decides to place the cube in there.
